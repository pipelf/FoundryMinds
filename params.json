  "body": "### About\r\nThis is a group of people with a hunger for creating and solving real problems. Foundry Minds is started as a need for keeping our creative minds active and as a medium to validate potential solutions as fast as possible for problems that are worth solving. Using Human Centered Design techniques, the group is an outlet to be creative and participate in the creation of potential new businesses and social ventures.\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity to dive in and learn as a group the concepts of [Human Centered Design](http://www.designkit.org/) and Design Thinking while applying them to real life needs.\r\n\r\nProduct concepts that demonstrate traction and have a potential for a good business model can be moved to the next stage for the creation of a business model and incubation of the product. Those in the group that are willing to move to this stage for a specific validated product will own and lead the effort of product development as founders.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal for Foundry Minds is to become a product design and validation outlet for the Gainesville Startup community and promote the creation of new ventures.\r\n\r\n### Design Process\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n### Sprints\r\n\r\n",
